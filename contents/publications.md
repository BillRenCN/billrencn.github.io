#### Mode Connectivity in Neural Networks using Bézier Surfaces
**Illinois Institute of Technology**  
This project explores mode connectivity in neural networks using Bézier surfaces to better understand the loss landscape.

- Developed a novel optimization framework extending mode connectivity from curves to surfaces using Bézier surfaces in PyTorch.
- Conducted experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using VGG16, ResNet18, and ViT architectures.
- Demonstrated applications such as model averaging and output ensembling.
- Supervised by Professor Ren Wang, with one paper under review at ICLR 2025.

#### Video Inpainting for Subtitles
**University of Wisconsin–Madison**  
Focused on improving video inpainting for subtitles using the ProPainter framework for ultra-high-definition images.

- Created a large dataset of high-quality images with subtitles for training models.
- Developed a two-stage pipeline for subtitle segmentation and inpainting.
- Optimized the ProPainter framework for this specific task under the guidance of Professor Yong Jae Lee.

#### Token Learner for Videos
**University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**  
Enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) efficiency by integrating token-learning capabilities for video data.

- Migrated parts of the project from TensorFlow to PyTorch to improve versatility.
- Implemented the token-learner feature specifically for video datasets.
